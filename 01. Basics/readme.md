# Basics of Rust

## Variables

We can use `let` to declare a variable. Variables are immutable by default. We can also use `var` to declare a mutable variable. The difference is, we can't change the value of a variable declared with `let` but we can change the value of a variable declared with `var`.

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```
